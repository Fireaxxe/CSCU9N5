                                Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical
                                and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software
                                systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

                                Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence,
                                computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction,
                                vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering,
                                bioinformatics and theory of computing.

                                Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is
                                only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to
                                solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. The
                                problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what
                                problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve
                                them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices,
                                that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

                                Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime
                                learners; they are able to adapt quickly with this challenging field.

                            <p class="heading sc-sp-data-dis">What is Coding</p>
                            <div class="data">
                                Coding (also called programming or developing) is telling a computer, app, phone or
                                website what you want it to do. Some educators and experts are calling it the ‘new
                                literacy’—a subject so important that every child needs to know the basics to excel in
                                our rapidly changing world.

                                Four- and five-year-olds can learn the foundations of coding and computer commands
                                before they can even write and spell words. Older kids can learn to code through
                                classes, mentors and online tutorials (see below for learn-to-code resources for all
                                ages).

                                Learning to code prepares kids for the world we live in today. There are tons of jobs
                                and occupations that use code directly, like web designers, software developers and
                                robotics engineers, and even more where knowing how to code is a huge asset—jobs in
                                manufacturing, nanotechnology or information sciences. However, for most kid-coding
                                advocates, reasons for learning to code run much deeper than career prep. Learning
                                coding empowers you to do many things you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do. These
                                things include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even
                                starting a technology business. Most importantly, you’ll be able to understand the
                                technology shaping your world.

                                You’ve undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right?
                                Well, people say that for a reason! Whether you’re looking for a career in the
                                industry, starting a new hobby or just wanting to understand technology, you can
                                benefit from learning coding.

                            <p class="heading sc-sp-data-dis">How Coding Works</p>
                            <div class="data">
                                So how does coding work, really? The short answer is that writing code tells the
                                computer what to do, but it’s not quite that simple.

                                So here’s the longer answer. A computer can only understand two distinct types of data:
                                on and off. In fact, a computer is really just a collection of on/off switches
                                (transistors). Anything that a computer can do is nothing more than a unique
                                combination of some transistors turned on and some transistors turned off.

                                Binary code is the representation of these combinations as 1s and 0s, where each digit
                                represents one transistor. Binary code is grouped into bytes, groups of 8 digits
                                representing 8 transistors. For example, 11101001. Modern computers contain millions or
                                even billions of transistors, which means an unimaginably large number of combinations.

                                But one problem arises here. To be able to write a computer program by typing out
                                billions of 1s and 0s would require superhuman brainpower, and even then it would
                                probably take you a lifetime or two to write.

                                This is where programming languages come in…

                                Programming Languages
                                Here’s a simple example of some code:

                                print 'Hello, world!'
                                That line of code is written in the Python programming language. Put simply, a
                                programming (or coding) language is a set of syntax rules that define how code should
                                be written and formatted.

                                Thousands of different programming languages make it possible for us to create computer
                                software, apps and websites. Instead of writing binary code, they let us write code
                                that is (relatively) easy for us to write, read and understand. Each language comes
                                with a special program that takes care of translating what we write into binary code.
                                There are different computer languages because different languages are designed to be
                                used for different purposes – some are useful for web development, others useful for
                                writing desktop software, others useful for solving scientific and numeric problems,
                                and so on.

                                The following languages provide a reasonable mixture of paradigms and practical

                                The primary advantage of Java application development is that it is free and its syntax
                                bears resemblance to various C-based programming languages, making it easier for

                                Haskell is the crown jewel of the Hindley-Milner family of languages. Fully exploiting
                                laziness, Haskell comes closest to programming in pure mathematics of any major
                                programming language.<br><br>

                                                R:</i></b></u></a>
                                R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is similar
                                to the S language and environment. R can be considered as a different implementation of
                                S.<br><br>

                                It’s an easy language that just about anyone can master in a short period of time. If
                                you’re impatient and want to make quick scripts that deliver results (and you don’t
                                mind very rudimentary debugging), then you should definitely explore it! See also

                                SQL is everywhere, and I'm not saying that because I want you to use it. It's just a
                                fact. I bet you have some in your pocket right now. All Android Phones and iPhones have
                                easy access to a SQL database called SQLite and many applications on your phone use it
                                directly. It runs banks, hospitals, universities, governments, small businesses, large
                                ones, just about every computer and every person on the planet eventually touches
                                something running SQL. SQL is an incredibly successful and solid technology.
